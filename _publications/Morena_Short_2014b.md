Abstract: We report on the tendency of chaotic systems to be controlled onto their unstable periodic orbits in such a way that these orbits are stabilized. The resulting orbits are known as cupolets and collectively provide a rich source of qualitative information on the associated chaotic dynamical system. We show that pairs of interacting cupolets may be induced into a state of mutually sustained stabilization that requires no external intervention in order to be maintained and is thus considered bound or entangled. A number of properties of this sort of entanglement are discussed. For instance, should the interaction be disturbed, then the chaotic entanglement would be broken. Based on certain properties of chaotic systems and on examples which we present, there is further potential for chaotic entanglement to be naturally occurring. A discussion of this and of the implications of chaotic entanglement in future research investigations is also presented.
